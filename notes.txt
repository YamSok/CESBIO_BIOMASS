The approaches for analyzing texture are very diverse, and differ from each other mainly by the method used for extracting textural features. Four categories can be defined: (1) statistical methods, (2) structural methods, (3) model-based methods, and (4) transform-based methods.


owever, prior to stacking, each 2-D FFT magnitude image was passed through a “Gaussian” filter (9×9 pixel convolution kernel, with σ=0.5) [35]. This filter serves as a low-pass smoothing function, which is mainly used to remove traces of high-frequency noise from the texture images. Further details on the Gaussian filter and other similar windowing functions may be found in Jenkins and Watts [41].


Therefore, if the frequency spectrum is decomposed appropriately, different texture will have different features. Denote by d(j)k (j=1, 2, … , J; k=h,v,d) the k-component of the detail sub-images of a grayscale image at the jth decomposition stage, where h, v, and d denote horizontal, vertical, and diagonal, respectively, as shown in Fig. 12. When each detail sub-image is treated as a matrix, then the energy of the detail sub-image is defined as(7)Ejk=‖d(j)k‖F2where ‖·‖F denotes the Frobenius norm. Often this is divided by the number of pixels, yielding normalized energy. When these energies are employed as elements of the textural feature vector, it is called the wavelet energy signature [6],
